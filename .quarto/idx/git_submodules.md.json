This is basically a\nrepository embedded in your **main** repository. This can be very\nuseful. A couple of usecases of submodules:\n\n- **Separate big codebases into multiple repositories.**\n\n    Useful if you have a big project that contains multiple subprojects.\n    You can make every subproject a submodule. This way you'll have a\n    cleaner Git log, because the commits are specific to a certain\n    submodule.\n\n- **Re-use the submodule in multiple parent repositories.**\n\n    Useful if you have multiple repositories that share a common \n    component. With this approach you can easily update that shared\n    component in all the repositories that added them as a submodule.\n    This is a lot more convienient than copy-pasting the code into the\n    repositories.\n\n\n### Basics\n\nWhen you add a submodule in Git, you don't add the **code** of the\nsubmodule to the main repository, you only add **information about the\nsubmodule** that is added to the main repository. This information\ndescribes which **commit the submodule is pointing** at. This way, the\nsubmodule's **code** won't automatically be updated if the submodule's\n**repository** is updated. This is good, because your **main**\nrepository might not work with the latest commit of the submodule; it\nprevents unexpected behaviour.\n\n\n### Adding a submodule\n\nYou can add a submodule to a repository like this:\n\n    git submodule add git@github.com:path_to/submodule.git path-to-submodule\n    git submodule add jpowerj@github.com:dsan-globals.git dsan-globals\n\nWith default configuration, this will check out the **code** of the\n`submodule.git` repository to the `path-to-submodule` directory, and\nwill **add information to the main repository** about this submodule,\nwhich contains the **commit the submodule points to**, which will be\nthe **current** commit of the default branch (usually the `master`\nbranch) at the time this command is executed.\n\nAfter this operation, if you do a `git status` you'll see two files in\nthe `Changes to be committed` list: the `.gitmodules` file and the path\nto the submodule. When you commit and push these files, you'll\ncommit/push the submodule to the origin.\n\n\n### Getting the submodule's code\n\nIf a new submodule is created by one person, the other people in the\nteam need to initiate this submodule. First you have to get the\n**information** about the submodule, this is retrieved by a normal\n`git pull`. If there are new submodules you'll see it in the output of\n`git pull`. Then you'll have to initiate them with:\n\n    git submodule init\n\nThis will pull all the **code** from the submodule and place it in the\ndirectory that it's configured to.\n\nIf you've cloned a repository that makes use of submodules, you should\nalso run this command to get the submodule's code. This is not\nautomatically done by `git clone`. However, if you add the\n`--recurse-submodules` flag, it will.\n\n\n### Pushing updates in the submodule\n\nThe submodule is just a separate repository. If you want to make changes\nto it, you should make the changes in its repository and push them like\nin a regular Git repository: Just execute the git commands in the\nsubmodule's directory. However, you should also let the **main**\nrepository know that you've updated the submodule's repository, and make\nit use the new commit of the repository of the submodule. Because if\nyou make new commits inside a submodule, the **main** repository will\nstill **point to the old commit**. \n\nIf there are changes in the submodule's repository, and you do a `git\nstatus` in the **main** repository, then the submodule will be in the\n`Changes not staged for commit` list, and will have the text `(modified\ncontent)` behind it. This means that the **code** of the submodule is\nchecked out on a different commit than the **main** repository is\n**pointing to**. To make the **main** repository **point to** this new\ncommit, you should create another commit in the **main** repository.\n\nThe next sections describe different scenarios on doing this.\n\n\n#### Make changes inside a submodule\n\n- `cd` inside the submodule directory.\n- Make the desired changes.\n- `git commit` the new changes.\n- `git push` the new commit.\n- `cd` back to the main repository.\n- In `git status` you'll see that the submodule directory is modified.\n- In `git diff` you'll see the old and new commit pointers.\n- When you `git commit` in the main repository, it will update the\n  pointer.\n\n\n#### Update the submodule pointer to a different commit\n\n- `cd` inside the submodule directory.\n- `git checkout` the branch/commit you want to point to.\n- `cd` back to the main repository.\n- In `git status` you'll see that the submodule directory is modified.\n- In `git diff` you'll see the old and new commit pointers.\n- When you `git commit` in the main repository, it will update the\n  pointer.\n\n\n#### If someone else updated the submodule pointer\n\nIf someone updated a submodule, the other team-members should update\nthe code of their submodules. This is not automatically done by\n`git pull`, because with `git pull` it only retrieves the\n**information** that the submodule is **pointing** to another\n**commit**, but doesn't update the submodule's **code**.\n\nTo see the current commits that are checked out for all your submodules:\n\n    git submodule status\n\nTo update the **code** of your submodules:\n\n    git submodule update\n    \nIf a submodule is not initiated yet, add the `--init` flag. If any\nsubmodule has submodules itself, you can add the `--recursive` flag to\nrecursively init and update submodules.\n\n##### What happens if you don't run this command?\n\nIf you don't run this command, the **code** of your submodule is checked\nout to an **old** commit. When you do `git status` in the **main**\nrepository, you will see the submodule in the `Changes not staged for\ncommit` list with the text `(modified content)` behind it. If you would\ndo a `git status` **inside** the submodule, it would say `HEAD detached\nat <commit-hash>`. This is not because you changed the submodule's code,\nbut because its **code** is checked out to a different **commit** than\nthe commit used in the **main** repository. So in the **main** repo, Git\nsees this as a change, but actually you just didn't update the submodule.\nSo if you're working with submodules, don't forget to keep your\nsubmodules up-to-date.\n\n\n### Making it easier for everyone\n\nIt is sometimes annoying if you forget to initiate and update your\nsubmodules. Fortunately, there are some tricks to make it easier:\n\n    git clone --recurse-submodules\n    \nThis will clone a repository and also init / update any possible\nsubmodules the repository has.\n\n    git pull --recurse-submodules\n    \nThis will pull the main repository and also it's submodules.\n\nAnd you can make it easier with aliases:\n\n    git config --global alias.clone-all 'clone --recurse-submodules'\n    git config --global alias.pull-all 'pull --recurse-submodules'","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["/dsan-globals/jjstyles.css"],"toc":true,"include-in-header":{"text":"<script
